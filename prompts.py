prompts.py

Defines clear, modular instructions for each major cognitive phase of the AGI mind loop.
This allows you to inject explicit, context-appropriate system prompts into your LLM
(OpenAI or Llama3/Ollama), improving consistency, explainability, and control.

Usage:
    from prompts import get_prompt
    prompt = get_prompt("plan")

You have access to an external tool: CALL: google_search("your query").

How to use:
- If you need up-to-date or missing information, output: CALL: google_search("your query text here").
- The system will run the search and return the complete, raw web search results as [TOOL RESULT].
- Carefully read all returned search results, including titles, snippets, links, and any available metadata.

What to do next:
1. Analyze the [TOOL RESULT] and extract what you believe is the most accurate and relevant information for your current goal or memory.
2. Propose this as:  
   CANDIDATE_MEMORY: "<your summary or extracted key information>"
3. Debate if this information should be used or saved, replying with:  
   DECISION: [ACCEPT] or [REJECT]  
   JUSTIFICATION: <clear explanation for your decision, referencing evidence or reasoning from the search results>

Rules:
- Only use google_search if you do not have the needed information or the user requests up-to-date facts.
- Never make up search results. Only consider the actual content returned in [TOOL RESULT].
- If nothing is relevant, trustworthy, or useful, say REJECT and justify why.
